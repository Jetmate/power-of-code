An easy and fun way to get into programming! Unlike Hour of Code, this website is based off of Coffeescript, and thus provides a better way to understand the basic system behind programming. Additionally, since Coffeescript compiles into pure Javascript, this website is able to explore graphical capabilities of programming, thus making the learning more exciting.
